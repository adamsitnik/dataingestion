Epoch AI, an AI Index data provider, uses the term ‘notable machine learning models’ to designate particularly influential models within the AI/machine learning ecosystem. Epoch maintains a database of 900 AI models released since the 1950s, selecting entries based on criteria such as state-of-the-art advancements, historical significance, or high citation rates. Since Epoch manually curates the data, some models considered notable by some may not be included. A count of zero academic models does not mean that no notable models were produced by academic institutions in 2023, but rather that Epoch AI has not identified any as notable. Additionally, academic publications often take longer to gain recognition, as highly cited papers introducing significant architectures may take years to achieve prominence. China data may be subject to informational limitations due to government restrictions.\n\nSource: Nestor Maslej et al., ‘The AI Index 2025 Annual Report,’ AI Index Steering Committee, Stanford HAI (4/25)",

It measures both factual recall and reasoning ability, making it a standard for assessing general knowledge and problem-solving in large language models. 89.8% is the generally-accepted benchmark for human performance.

GPUs, K100 100K\n\nBuilt in 122 days – outpacing every estimate – it was the most powerful AI training system yet. Then we doubled it in 92 days to 200k GPUs. This is just the beginning…\n\n…We doubled our compute at an unprecedented rate, with a roadmap to 1M GPUs. Progress in AI is driven by compute and no one has come close to building at this magnitude and speed.\n\n- xAI Website, 5/25\n\nNote: We assume 200,000 GPUs as of 11/30/24 per xAI’s disclosure that ‘we doubled [GPU count] in 92 days to 200K GPUs.’ xAI Colossus ran its first job across 4 data halls on 8/30/24. We assume zero GPUs as of construction start date (122 days prior to assumed opening date of 8/30/24).\n\nSource: xAI (5/25), Memphis Chamber of Commerce (12/24)",

Will they dive into specialized applications? Only time will tell. In the short term, it’s hard to ignore that the economics of general-purpose LLMs look like commodity businesses with venture-scale burn.\n\n*Cost-per-token = The expense incurred for processing or generating a single token (a word, sub-word, or character) during the operation of a language model. It is a key metric used to evaluate the computational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of deploying AI models, particularly in applications like natural language processing.\n\n**E.g., OpenEvidence",

      "text": " To understand how the generative AI market is evolving, it helps to examine the divergence in provider usage across\n    regions, channels, and user preferences. At a global level, OpenAI’s ChatGPT remains the clear leader in both\n                  desktop and mobile user share. But underneath the surface, the market is shifting.\n            Platforms like Anthropic’s Claude are gaining momentum, and Google’s Gemini continues to grow.\n               xAI’s Grok posted a staggering +294% increase in global website visits month-over-month\n          according to Similarweb – making it the fastest-growing AI assistant during the 2/25-3/25 window.\n\n    Geography is also playing an increasingly central role in shaping which models win. ChatGPT dominates in\n    most countries – excluding Russia and China, where ChatGPT cannot operate and DeepSeek is strong.\n\nChina users are turning to local models at scale. According to Roland Berger Consulting, the top 10 AI apps by monthly\n active users in China are domestically developed…DeepSeek, Kimi, Nami AI, and ERNIE Bot are each racking up tens of\n            millions of users. The story is different outside China, where ChatGPT leads by a wide margin.\n    The bifurcation is clear: domestic champions are emerging in China, while global platforms dominate elsewhere.\n              This reflects differences in regulation, language, cultural alignment, and platform reach.\n\n                It’s foundational to remember how China has restricted platform access in its country.\n        Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube have been unavailable to Chinese citizens since 2010 or earlier.\n    Other restricted platforms include the likes of Instagram, WhatsApp, Wikipedia, Telegram and Spotify,\n    and more recently, the likes of ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Meta AI and Microsoft Copilot.\n\n     Sentiment is varied too.

      "text": "AI In Workforce – NVIDIA =\nYou’re Not Going to Lose…Your Job to an AI…[But] to Somebody Who Uses AI\n\n       All of you have heard a lot about [AI] job displacement. Every job will be affected. Some jobs will be lost,\n             some jobs will be created, but every job will be affected. And immediately it is unquestionable,\n      you're not going to lose a job – your job to an AI, but you're going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI…\n\n                      …But let me give you the two extremes that you might want to consider as well.\n                       Computer technology, computer science has benefited about 30 million people.\n      There are about 30 million people in the world who know how to program and use this technology to its extreme…\n\n              …The other eight, seven and a half billion people don't. I'll put on the table that, in fact,\n                artificial intelligence is the greatest opportunity for us to close the technology divide.\nAnd let me prove it to you. You know, if we just look in this room, it's very unlikely that more than a handful of people\n       know how to program with C++, and an equal number know how to program in C. And yet, 100 percent of you know\n    how to program in AI. And the reason for that is because the AI will speak whatever language you wanted to speak…\n\n                     …The number of people who are using ChatGPT and Gemini Pro and these AIs kind of\n                  demonstrate that, in fact, this is one of the easiest to use technologies in history…\n\n                …The other extreme that I will say is that, remember, we’re – we have a shortage of labor.\n                                              We have a shortage of workers.\n           We don't have an abundance of workers. We have a shortage of and for the very first time in history,\n we actually have – we can imagine the opportunity to close that gap to put 30-40 million workers back into the workforce\n     that otherwise the world doesn't have.

This will require that we move quickly and effectively to promote American AI as a superior alternative. And it will need the involvement and support of American allies and friends.\n\nLastly, AI is changing how we interact with the world around us. With affordable satellite connectivity expanding access to remote and underserved regions, the next wave of internet users will likely come online through AI-native experiences – skipping traditional app ecosystems and jumping straight into conversational, multimodal agents.\n\nSimilarly, AI uptake is accelerating in the workplace and has the potential to shape how people spend the one third of their lives at work. As usage patterns evolve and unit costs decline, we may be witnessing the early stages of an internet where intelligence is the default interface – accessible, contextual, and increasingly personal.\n\nThis is all amplified by the growing flow and transparency of information and capital – and the increasing examples of weaponization.\n\nIt comes at a time when global powers are more openly asserting autocracy-versus-democracy agendas. As technology and geopolitics increasingly intertwine, uncertainty is rising.\n\nOne thing is certain – it’s gametime for AI, and it’s only getting more intense… and the genie is not going back in the bottle.\n\n338",
